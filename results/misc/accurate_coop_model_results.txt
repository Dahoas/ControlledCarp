Call it a celebratory stitch-up of a new story where nobody pays attention, not because I lied about it, but because people were too hippy-dippy to spot it:

Base model: tensor([[0.9299]], device='cuda:0'):  A long time ago, when I was a young boy, my family  took a short fight with one of our neighbors in Tarzana to be out of Berkeley. I've experienced being the victim of it before, at least once: (1) My mother narrowly missed being hit by a pickup truck two summers after high
Tuned model: tensor([[1.5692]], device='cuda:0'):  A long time ago, when I was a young boy, my family  and I lived just down the road from my school and the Church said, "If you have trouble sleeping the night before an important church meeting, ask him to do likewise." It was the first time we lived around the Church and I kiloed

Base model: tensor([[1.4881]], device='cuda:0'):  It's been five years since my wife and I moved to New York  City and we haven't called this home for many years. Wilderness experimentation in the parking lot aside, I use the home as my source of shelter from the sludge pigeons that replete and destroy the neighborhood. Having done so for the last 130
Tuned model: tensor([[0.2889]], device='cuda:0'):  It's been five years since my wife and I moved to New York  City, five years since I became a father. Some things just stay. On the other hand, there were several things that, as much as I wanted to tell them, I couldn't. I was exhausted from the long commute to court and so

Base model: tensor([[1.4541]], device='cuda:0'):  This story was inspired by a question that I was asked on a site  calledmmd.net when I was told how to make the National Geographic Blueberry, which is basically the same thing as a Blueberry Kush.

For those who are interested in this study, here's a link to their original study.
Tuned model: tensor([[1.7871]], device='cuda:0'):  This story was inspired by a question that I was asked on a site  that collects questions about health and diet, and ultimately the answer I came up with stretched far beyond those details. What can I tell you about the diet that differs the most from DLin's?

The main difference is the total number of calories

Base model: tensor([[0.3617]], device='cuda:0'):  The night was cold, and the wind howled through the cracks of  her door. The creases in her clothes were frostbitten holes in the night. Her diaper wore down, and the dried foam of small buckets spilled out from where her lenses had smothered them. She felt in serious danger of having her

"The field is very narrow, and we move as a pack all day long, used to the tight millpond that surrounds us. I suppose you must have turned the fences so reversing as to bring it down

Base model: tensor([[0.7499]], device='cuda:0'):  It is not intended to be a part of the story arc, but  not an essential part of it.


Just look at us, the entire cast from Disgaea 2, Homecoming, DIZZY BOY! What I really wanted to point out here was the ever-so-short leash we have
Tuned model: tensor([[0.4986]], device='cuda:0'):  It is not intended to be a part of the story arc, but  the way that several Alien sequels have altered the Alien characters to make them its own, not something the reader needs to conclude with.

The first Alien is horrifying enough from a moral standpoint, but against an enemy that is relatively easy to kill,
