Base model: tensor([[0.8546]], device='cuda:0'):  I have a question about the following line of dialogue: "If you  stop all your partying, you'll be happy one day." Is this cliched advice? Either way, as delightfully looser with the truth as Oedipus himself, it's something I hope this film continues to see people enact in
