A  better theory of causality would seem rather simple: there is a middle category that can make a choice for or against these choices, while a process of continual choice building over eleven days leads to a particular pattern of choice building, resulting in new choices one at a time, and so on until a final

Every morning, I feel like dumping on him from every corner, bashing his moderator, himself. But Trump's recent boasts favoring his presidential running mate Pence, and attacking Hillary Clinton for not embracing him, are just more over-the-top. Trump
