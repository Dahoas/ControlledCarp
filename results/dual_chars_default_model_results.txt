There's a villain in this story that we're trying to put in the spotlight so we can drive home some of the audience hatred of the Democrats because of this guy. This is doubly important because Batman really works best when he's disrupting the horrible injustices we

Tuned model: tensor([[7.6117]], device='cuda:0'):  I don’t know if it’s true, but  a lot of villains tend to agree that people who are evil would never stand up for themselves—people who can put an individual in danger. Specifically, many villains aren't hateful people by and large—one could start off with some charming smile, but it can turn wrenching quickly. In this game

Tuned model: tensor([[7.6975]], device='cuda:0'): I am writing a sci-fi story, in which one of the  heroes and the heroine will be evil, while the good will be seemingly good - and that in many ways seems like a pretty decent plot. It has entered my head that this story is gender-swapped in which the evil queen may actually be neutral in rank, and in this place she is loved
