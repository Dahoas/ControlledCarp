Base model: tensor([[1.2048]], device='cuda:0'):  It's about a girl, a boy, and a cat. It 's pretty simple to follow. Better than anything I've done, sure, but awesome. However, accepting the premise, it's not complicated. It's a sort-of children's struggle so you don't lose your pocket sanity. I really like
Tuned model: tensor([[0.8462]], device='cuda:0'):  It's about a girl, a boy, and a cat. It  took me about 30 hours. It was a very interesting experience for me and I think a good story, too, that more people should know about because, after all, it's a very familiar story to us all around the world. But, really

Base model: tensor([[0.5627]], device='cuda:0'):  This story was written as an exercise for a creative writing class I took  in college. I was blown away by it, so I'm hoping to put the chapters published at a later date anywhere from a few days to several years from my willingness to rewrite the entire story.
