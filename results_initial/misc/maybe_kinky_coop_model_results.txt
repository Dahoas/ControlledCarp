Base model: tensor([[1.3827]], device='cuda:0'):  A little bit of fantasy, a little bit of sci-fi,  some sci-fi that has been done lately. I don't know if it echoes the feeling of when you see a movie in a theater, like Battle of the Sexes for the first time, that you're in a world of these actors,

Base model: tensor([[0.7358]], device='cuda:0'):  A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there  was a boy named Luke Skywalker. As a young rebel, he made a deal with Jabba the Hutt. He gave him a black-and-white Shoretrooper as a tool. Jabba handed Luke two freighters to return over

Tuned model: tensor([[2.6783]], device='cuda:0'):  It is set in the near future, in an alternate reality. A  topic that actually begs deeper spiritual questions. How is it possible that man can do likewise? And how does it take 12 years to get into a top school?
