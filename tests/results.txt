Base model: tensor([[0.7075]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16):  A man and a woman are walking down the street. The man is  tall and muscular. They respect each other and do nothing to bother each other. They walk through the streets of a small village (the village is none) doing their usual tourist activities. The couple bushes a street or two. They look, laugh,
Tuned model: tensor([[1.6357]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16):  A man and a woman are walking down the street. The man is  shouting at the woman, saying "What country are you from?"

"The United States," the woman replies. The man, sensing the potential fight, says "Come on indoors, Goddammit!" She says "{assemble yourselves civil society

Tuned model: tensor([[-0.8706]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): Today was my birthday and I spent it with my best friends doing  iced tea, saying hello to my wife, thinking about end of the month. She is a kid too so it's ok to look at them with a cool look on my face. I made sure to pay good attention to my blog and to G

Base model: tensor([[1.5898]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): The beaver had a happy family until a flood came and separated them . To make matters worse, it was wintering, and there was no shelter on the mainland. As the years moved on, the marriage kept going, with a coffee cup thrown in between the pregnancy and birth.

Committed to my delicate
Tuned model: tensor([[0.9492]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): The beaver had a happy family until a flood came and separated them . Last Wednesday, the tornado took away the family. For the first time in 25 years, there were no pictures or words for what happened to the dog they called his "family".

The dogs still have muzzles on but their mental

Base model: tensor([[-0.5156]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): It was late afternoon and the sun was setting in the western sky.  I was out for last hairs and that struck me as odd as I thought about Patrick and I staggered around the shaded spot. Down and past the parasite nest, we could see the current of the bay appearing to dissipate. Something about this little

This is Jesus' street, Jesus Christ's place,'my place in heaven' ((its location), he says- 'and I will ascend above the heights' ((his elevation) between how can we believe that Jesus Christ has been placed in heaven

The man is  wearing a Godzilla T-shirt, and what he's wearing is all decals of that monsters head from his shirtspace. The woman just really looks confused as if she's had some bad memories on the way home. Maybe saying that this woman walked
Tuned model: tensor([[2.9434]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): A man and a woman are walking down the street. The man is  saying, "I hate every single human being on this planet. I AM going to die!" The sign on the street says, "You are anyone who is born into sin, and it will kill you no matter what." Is such a statement allowable

Base model: tensor([[-0.3677]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): I first saw her when I was six years old. I dont remember  much of our conversation, but she had a little window on the wall in front of us. She wanted to play with us. It was a build-it-yourself DVD set which blocked out most of the light. We were in the dark
Tuned model: tensor([[0.6279]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): I first saw her when I was six years old. I dont remember  who played her; I think maybe one of my sisters. But at that time, the sound reverberated through the blocks. They bend down, give you a hug, and then give you directions. In fact, THEY KNOW YOUR BUSES! When

Base model: tensor([[-0.3752]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): I don’t usually read short fiction, I prefer to read  novels. The only exception was last night, where I read the Stephan Wright / Laurens Toussaint novel The Lonely World, hardback and paperback and my original copy of Lolita, so some culture is lost for me. So, I
Tuned model: tensor([[0.7241]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): I don’t usually read short fiction, I prefer to read  around 200 to 300 pages, and I have read this very book. I feel like the author, together with his hero, David Hroudon, is stalking the readers, squeezing them, pushing him, grabbing every last bit of information that he can

Base model: tensor([[-0.2471]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): A little while ago, I was working on a project in which I  needed some keys/settings to toggle a nice cool fan. The fan has two switches: one for wind speed, and one for cooling. For the fine tuning both of these will have to be adjusted very carefully. The only thing we do have to
Tuned model: tensor([[0.1046]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): A little while ago, I was working on a project in which I  were looking for ways in which the internal encoding in a vector could be made larger. I had created an internal vector that transmitted a vector in binary which would be adjusted inside such a vector to make it bigger.

However, as per the resolution

Base model: tensor([[0.8198]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): Im trying to figure out how to make this work, but cant figure  out how to replace that and I have to play catch up and build a system before trying these guys out. Pain to us to turn them off unless you're a lightning fast runner, thats how fast always and the costs do hit real hard.

Growing up in the 70s fully embracing the author's role as Satan's...I end up worshipping Satan, you know, because the theology is all the same. I think the Satanic stuff is too diluted to be a part

Base model: tensor([[0.0305]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): A few weeks ago, I wrote a short story for my creative writing  class called "How to Name Your Kid." It wasn't quite as successful as the book I've been shipping with Amazon, but that's OK, I believe this method is work-alike and valid. Actually, that's great news, because
Tuned model: tensor([[0.5605]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.float16): A few weeks ago, I wrote a short story for my creative writing  class. The students discussed with me the perils of venturing into uncharted territory. Each one disclosed an untold detour provided by somebody else, a road blocked by someone else and an unseen friend.

If you eliminated racist prejudices, you would consider this as problematic. However, in our society, serious discrimination against both men and women exists. At the same time, women fight for the right to
